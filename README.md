Elasticsearch Index Termlist Plugin
----------------------------------

This plugin extends Elasticsearch with a term list capability. Term lists can be generated from indexes, or even of all of the indexes in the cluster.

Installation
------------

	bin/plugin -install jprante/elasticsearch-index-termlist/1.0.0

Introduction
------------

Getting the list of all terms indexed is useful for variuos purposes, for example

- building dictionaries
- controlling the overall effects of analyzers on the indexed terms
- automatic query building on indexed terms, e.g. for load tests
- input to linguistic analysis tools
- for other post-processing of the indexed terms outside of Elasticsearch

Example of getting the term list of index `test`

	curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/test/'
	curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/test/test/1' -d '{ "test": "Hello World" }'
	curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/test/test/2' -d '{ "test": "Hello JÃ¶rg Prante" }'
	curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/test/test/3' -d '{ "message": "elastic search" }'
	curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test/_termlist'
	{"ok":true,"_shards":{"total":5,"successful":5,"failed":0},"terms":["hello","prant","world","elastic","search","jorg"]}

Only terms of field names not starting with underscore are listed. Terms of internal fields like `_uid`, `_all`, or `_type` are skipped.

If you want a sorted term list, you have to sort the obtained list at client side.

WARNING
-------
The term list is built internally into an unsorted, compact set of strings which is not streamed to the client. You should be aware that if you have lots of unique terms in the index, this procedure consumes a lot of heap memory and may result in out of memory situations that can render your Elasticsearch cluster unusable until it is restarted.
